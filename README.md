## some pointers on the exercise
- I tried to keep the implementation a bit simpler. Hence, not adding any dependencies.
- The code can be much more cleaner and modular. I was mostly focused on the implementing the tasks first which left me no time to make the code a bit more clean.
- I have not used framer. Adding that will make the UIs more smoother!
- I have made use of AI for helping me in completing this task.
- There are some bugs in animation of the delete with slide and toast notification on delete. Again, I would prefer using some component library for this and not implementing it from scratch.
